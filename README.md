# jfq
Exposing [JSONata](http://jsonata.org/) on the command line.

This was inspired by the excellent [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) utility, and uses JSONata rather than the
`jq` language.  It is an early prototype and breaking changes are probable.

## Installation
```
npm install --save jfq
```
